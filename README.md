Martel Sans Long
================

Martel Sans Long is a libre font development project (Latin-script-only at this time). It is a special version of the <a href="https://github.com/typeoff/martel_sans">Martel Sans</a> font family developed for a Braunschweig/Leipzig-based book designer duo. Martel Sans was designed by Dan Reynolds and Mathieu Réguer.

Why is it called “Long?” Because all of the ascenders and descenders are longer than they are in Martel Sans.

Martel Sans Long is available libre and gratis. There are two folders for this project. One folder contains the project source: a Glyphs 2 file, with both masters. The other folder contains the fonts: eight .OTF files (UltraLight, Light, Regular, Medium, DemiBold, Bold, ExtraBold and Heavy). All files are offered as-is.
