Martel Sans Long
================

Martel Sans Long is a libre font development project (Latin-script-only at this time). It is a special version of the <a href="https://github.com/typeoff/martel_sans">Martel Sans</a> font family developed for a Braunschweig/Leipzig-based book designer duo. Martel Sans was designed by Dan Reynolds and Mathieu Réguer.

Why is it called “Long?” Because all of the ascenders and descenders are longer than they are in Martel Sans. There is more space between the x-height and accents & tittles, too.

Martel Sans Light is made available libre and gratis. All files are offered as-is.
